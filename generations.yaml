  - name: "First Generation (E84)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The original BMW X1 was the brand's first compact luxury crossover, based on the E91 3 Series Touring platform. Unlike later models, it featured a longitudinal engine layout with rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel drive. Engine options included four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol and diesel units. The E84 X1 offered car-like handling with a slightly elevated driving position and more versatile interior space. It established BMW in the growing compact premium crossover segment, though some markets initially viewed it as too similar to the 3 Series Touring."

  - name: "Second Generation (F48)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The F48 X1 marked a significant platform shift, moving to BMW's UKL front-wheel drive architecture shared with MINI. This change allowed for more efficient packaging, resulting in increased interior space despite similar exterior dimensions. Engine options were exclusively four-cylinder units with front-wheel drive standard and xDrive optional. The design became more SUV-like with a higher riding position and more upright stance. Technology advanced with larger infotainment screens, enhanced driver assistance systems, and improved connectivity. A plug-in hybrid variant (xDrive25e) was added later in the production run."

  - name: "Third Generation (U11)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The current X1 builds on the UKL platform with more assertive styling featuring a larger kidney grille, angular headlights, and more pronounced body lines. It's slightly larger in all dimensions, offering increased passenger and cargo space. The interior represents a significant modernization with BMW's curved display combining digital instruments and infotainment, fewer physical buttons, and enhanced technology. Powertrain options include gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid variants, with the all-electric iX1 joining the lineup for the first time. Performance has improved across the range, with the M35i offering up to 312 HP. The third-generation X1 has grown into a more substantial vehicle that better differentiates itself from BMW's sedan and hatchback offerings."
