generations:
  - name: "First Generation (E84)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The original BMW X1 was the brand's first compact luxury crossover, based on the E90 3 Series platform. Unlike later models, it featured a longitudinal engine layout with rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel drive. Engine options included four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol and diesel units. The E84 X1 offered car-like handling with a slightly elevated driving position and more versatile interior space. It underwent a facelift in 2013 with restyled exterior and interior design elements. It established BMW in the growing compact premium crossover segment, though some markets initially viewed it as too similar to the 3 Series Touring. The original E84 X1 sold 820,529 units."

  - name: "Second Generation (F48)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The F48 X1 is the second-generation model built upon BMW's UKL2 platform, marking a significant shift to front-wheel drive architecture shared with the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and Mini Countryman. This change allowed for more efficient packaging, resulting in increased interior space despite similar exterior dimensions. Engine options include turbocharged 3-cylinder and 4-cylinder petrol and diesel units, with front-wheel drive standard and xDrive optional. The design became more SUV-like with a higher riding position and more upright stance. Technology advanced with larger infotainment screens, enhanced driver assistance systems, and improved connectivity. A plug-in hybrid variant (xDrive25e) was added later in the production run."

  - name: "Third Generation (U11)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The current X1 (U11) is built on the same UKL2 platform as the previous generation, with a more assertive design featuring a larger kidney grille, angular headlights, and more pronounced body lines. It's slightly larger in all dimensions, offering increased passenger and cargo space. The interior represents a significant modernization with BMW's curved display combining digital instruments and infotainment, fewer physical buttons, and enhanced technology. Powertrain options include gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid variants, with the all-electric iX1 joining the lineup for the first time. Like the previous model, AWD models are badged as xDrive, and a China-exclusive long-wheelbase model (U12) is available. Performance has improved across the range, with various engine options available."
